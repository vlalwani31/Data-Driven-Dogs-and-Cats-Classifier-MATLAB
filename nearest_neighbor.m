%This function takes in a training data matrix Xtrain, training
%label vector ytrain and uses them to compute the average cat
%and dog vectors. It also takes in a test data matrix Xtest and 
%produces a vector of label guesses yguess. Each guess is found
%by searching through Xtrain to find the closest row, and then 
%outputting its label.
function yguess = nearest_neighbor(Xtrain,ytrain,Xtest)
    [~,xn] = min(pdist2(Xtrain,Xtest));
    yguess = ytrain(xn);
